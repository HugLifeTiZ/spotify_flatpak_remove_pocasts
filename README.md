# spotify_flatpak_remove_pocasts

Script to remove podcasts from Spotify's homepage on Flatpak. Operates on per-user Flatpak installation if Spotify is found there, system-wide installation otherwise. Will invoke sudo to operate on system-wide installation.

Needs to be re-run everytime Spotify is updated.
